# IBN Project Action Plan

This document outlines the key steps to complete and productionize the IBN toolset.

---

## 1. Secrets & Environment Hardening
- Store all sensitive values (DB, API keys, tokens) in Vault.
- Remove all hardcoded secrets and `.env` files from code.
- Update all services to fetch secrets from Vault at runtime.
- Set `DEBUG = False` and restrict `ALLOWED_HOSTS` in all Django and backend configs.
- Use strong, unique `SECRET_KEY` values.

## 2. Secure Networking
- Set up HTTPS for all web-facing services (frontend, backend, Vault-UI).
- Restrict access to Vault, DB, and Redis to internal networks only.
- Use firewalls and security groups to limit exposure.

## 3. Database & Storage
- Use production-grade databases (Postgres, MySQL) with regular backups.
- Secure DB access with strong passwords and network rules.
- Enable DB encryption if supported.



## 8. Backup & Disaster Recovery
- Schedule regular backups for DBs and Vault.
- Document restore procedures.


## 10. Final Testing & Launch
- Run end-to-end tests in a staging environment.
- Perform security and performance audits.
- Launch to production and monitor closely.
